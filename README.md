This project is an implementation of Battleship in Java.


The game is single player, with the user playing against a Computers random moves.
In order for this project to work, in the Game.java file, you must change the paths for the userfleet and compfleet files to the correct path so that the Scanner will be able to actually read the required inputs. Furthermore, you can change the layout of the ships in the userfleet and compfleet files by changing the start and end tiles for each ship. The rest of the project should be pretty intuitive, and please let me know if there are any questions.
